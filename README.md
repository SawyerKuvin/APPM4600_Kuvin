This repository contains the homeworks and labs of the CU-Boulder Applied Mathematics course: APPM 4600 - Numerical Methods and Scientific Computing. 
It is sorted in to my work for the Labs (usually done the day of their assignment) and the homeworks (tend to be more in depth), and may eventually contain
code related to my final project in this course.

This repository was made by a student at the University of Colorado Boulder :D
